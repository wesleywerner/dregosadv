! A very simple aid, but useful. This grew out of discussion with Luc French
! when he suggested, as a beta tester, simpler ways to beta test. A big nod
! to Jonadab as he seems to have been the originator of this idea in a game
! of his that Luc had beta tested.
!
! This makes a game more easily beta testable (especially a large game).
!
! Entering "beta test on" turns beta testing mode on. It does not need to
! be turned off once on. It will be automatically turned off upon quitting.
!
! What it does:
! 1. Turns on scripting. So a beta tester's moves can be recorded to a file.
! 2. Also turns on the commenting function. Allows a beta tester to make
!    comments (such as when finding a bug) which appear on the screen and
!    will also be saved in the script file, but not be parsed by the game.
!    Comments must be preceded by a !. Example: ! comment. As with any
!    single letter Inform command, such as x lamp, the ! must be followed
!    by a space before the rest of the line/comment is entered.
!
! This means beta testers don't need to go through the script file later
! to make comments. They can make comments as they play/beta test. (They
! could anyway, but it is annoying when the game says, "I didn't understand
! that sentence.", or tries to do an inventory or something. :-) )
!
! To start a game with beta testing automatically on, just put
! <<BestTestOn>>; at the end of the Initialise routine.
!
! Include after parser.h.

! Comments:  I assume this would not be released in a finished game, only
! during beta testing. But who knows? Anyone with a little bit of Inform
! knowledge could have written this, but I figured I would share it anyway.

! Version 1.01 - Added a few comments.
! Version 1.02 - Added a few more comments.
